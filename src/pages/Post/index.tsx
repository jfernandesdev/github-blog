        <p>
          Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these
          often differ from one language to another. This article attempts to
          list the built-in data structures available in JavaScript and what
          properties they have. These can be used to build other data
          structures. Wherever possible, comparisons with other languages are
          drawn.

        <a>Dynamic typing</a>

        <p>
          JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in
          JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type,
          and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all
          types:
        </p>
      </PostContent>
    </>
  )
